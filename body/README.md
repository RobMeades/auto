These are the 3D-printable files for the body of the automated vehicle.  All are based on the marvellous [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871), which can be found on Thingiverse.

- `mini.zip` is a zipped version of `mini.blend` (otherwise it is too big for Github) which is a Blender-import of [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871) scaled to full/actual size.
- `components.blend` modifies the [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871) to provide a separate body shell (the fuselage), wheel hub, tyre and chassis (which remains a work in progress).
- `fuselage.stl` and `wheel_hub.stl` are the parts from `components.blend` exported at a Blender scale factor of 30.48 to form a 1/32 scale model suitable for printing on a resin printer such as the Prusa SL1.
- `tyre.stl` is the same but should probably be printed on an FDM printer with a suitable flexible filament.
