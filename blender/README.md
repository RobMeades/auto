These are the 3D-printable files for `auto`.  `mini.blend` and the exports `wheel_front.stl`, `wheel_rear.stl`, `tyre.stl` and `hub_cap.stl` are based on the marvellous [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871), which can be found on Thingiverse; `chassis.blend` and its export `chassis.stl` are my own.

- `mini.zip` is a zipped version of `mini.blend` (otherwise it is too big for Github) which is a Blender-import of [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871) scaled to full/actual size.
- `mini.blend` modifies the [original mini by Patrickart](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5119871) to provide a separate body shell, front and rear wheels, tyre and hub-cap.
- `body.stl`, `wheel_front.stl`, `wheel_rear.stl`, `tyre.stl` and `hub_cap.stl` are the parts from `mini.blend` exported at a Blender scale factor of 30.48 to form a 1/32 scale model suitable for printing on a resin printer such as the Prusa SL1.  All should be printed in a tough white resin that will take paint, e.g. [Prusament Alabaster White](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-resin-model-alabaster-white-1kg/), aside from `tyre.stl` which should be printed in a black flexible resin, e.g. [Prusament Flex80](https://prusament.com/resin-material/prusament-resin-flex/).
- `chassis.blend` are all of the chassis components, including mountings for motors, axles, gears, a battery and electronics, all at 1:1 scale.
- `chassis.stl` is `chassis.blend` exported to STL at a scale of 1:1 suitable for printing on a resin printer such as the Prusa SL1.  All should be printed in a hard engineering resin such as [Siraya Tech Build](https://siraya.tech/pages/build-user-guide).
